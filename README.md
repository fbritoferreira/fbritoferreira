### [Why I Interview Once a Year (Even When I'm Not Job Hunting)](https://www.fbritoferreira.com/blog/why-i-interview-once-a-year-even-when-not-job-hunting)
_6 Oct 2024_

In this blog post, I discuss the benefits of conducting annual job interviews, even when you're not actively job hunting. Regular interviewing helps with market awareness, skill benchmarking, networking, and boosting confidence. It also prepares you for unexpected career changes and strengthens your position in salary negotiations. Openly discussing this practice with your manager fosters transparency, trust, and could lead to internal growth opportunities. This approach is a proactive way to stay competitive and agile in your professional development, without compromising loyalty to your current employer.
