### Software Engineer

_Sky Uk | 09/2018 - 02/2023_

#### Sky GO

Develop the sky go app, allowing sky customers to watch their content anywhere, worked on the MAC/Windows app. Built our development tooling such as a fully automated way to sign our app and upload the assets to the current buckets in Akamai. The technology stack consisted of Javascript/Typescript/React/redux

#### NOWTV

Worked on creating a dashboard and analysis tools for our ci/cd pipelines. The Tech stack consisted of React Native/Redux/Typescript

#### NOWTV Core Team
Worked on adding analytics to our CI/CD system, we created a system using AWS technologies such as AWS SQS to create a pub/sub system that keeps track of our ci/cd build times and alerts us when something fails. We had all our code running in AWS lambda for our backend/API tasks and used AWS EKS for the front end and other services that couldn’t be serverless. For long-term storage we S3 Glacier and normal S3 for assets and for short-term storage, we also used S3 to hold our Lambda functions configuration, this was all built using AWS SDK (typescript)

#### NOWTV Sales & Service
Worked on the My Account team of NOWTV, the main job was to maintain and develop new features of my account dashboard. Also worked as part of the Europe rebuild team as we started from scratch on creating the new multi-territory and multi-proposition apps for my account team. Before the rebuild we had 12 separate apps per territory, after the rebuild, we end up with two main apps and some smaller ones, this allowed us to simplify and code and make sure all our features could be turned on/off in any territory or proposition. The technology stack on here was typescript with react/redux and concourse as our ci.

#### NOWTV Web Backend for Front Ends
Built out a GraphQL layer to act as middleware between the frontend website and the many rest APIs. Use GraphQL to aggregate and filter responses from multiple data providers, giving frontend teams an abstraction layer. The main GraphQL server is built on top of the Apollo server and AWS lambda (serverless) with Redis as a caching layer. We managed to get three nines’ availability and obfuscate downstream downtime.
